# WALLPAPER-Z

A small collection of some of my favourite wallpapers that I always make sure to have on every machine I use.

#### `rename.py`

This simple python script batch names the file names of the images in `wallpapers` to numbered files. You could change it to rename them to whatever fits your needs.
